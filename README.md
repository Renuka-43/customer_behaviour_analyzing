📊 Data Analytics Project
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python, SQL, and Power BI. It includes data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL querying, dashboard development, reporting, and automated presentation creation.

The goal of this project is to transform raw data into actionable insights using industry-standard tools and best practices.

📂 Dataset

Source: [Add dataset source here – e.g., Kaggle, internal database, etc.]

Format: CSV / Excel / Database

Size: [e.g., 50,000 rows × 12 columns]

Domain: [e.g., Sales, Finance, Marketing, Healthcare]

The dataset contains structured data used to analyze trends, performance metrics, and key business indicators.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python

pandas

numpy

matplotlib / seaborn

SQL

PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

Power BI

Gamma (for PPT generation)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

🔎 Steps Performed
1. Data Loading

Imported dataset using pandas

Checked data structure and data types

Identified missing values and duplicates

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics

Distribution analysis

Correlation analysis

Trend and pattern identification

Data visualization (bar charts, histograms, heatmaps, etc.)

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values

Removed duplicates

Standardized column names

Corrected data types

Treated outliers (if applicable)

4. SQL Analysis

Imported cleaned data into PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server

Wrote queries for:

Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

Grouping and filtering

Joins (if multiple tables)

Subqueries and CTEs

Extracted business insights using SQL

5. Power BI Dashboard

Connected Power BI to the dataset/database

Created data model (relationships if needed)

Built interactive dashboard with:

KPI cards

Trend analysis

Category breakdowns

Filters and slicers

6. Report Creation

Summarized key findings

Highlighted business insights

Provided recommendations based on data

7. PPT Generation (Gamma)
